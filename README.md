We try to understand how different elements drive shopper's mindset while shopping over an e-commerce website. We have used data of OLIST store obtained from kaggle.
We have used tableau to analyze the data where we have created a story as well as a dashboard to summarise everything. We have included a powerpoint presentation to give the overall picture.

I have included the tableau file and powerpoint file, as well as the link to the file stored in tableau public repository : [E-commerce tableau online](https://public.tableau.com/views/project_tableau_17301352230320/Dashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

The following link is to a story created in tableau on review score: [Review Score Story](https://public.tableau.com/views/ReviewScoreStory/reviewscorestory?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Below is a screenshot of the dashboard.
